# House-Insurance-Customer-Retention-Project
Kangaroo is a House Insurance American Company that is concerned about the company’s retention rates and wants to know what is causing policy cancellation and also retain existing customers. The aim of this project is to create a retention model to identify policies that will be renewed or canceled before the end of the term and understand what variables are most influential in causing a policy cancellation. The Kangaroo data set is based on 4 years of property insurance policies from 2013 to 2017. There are almost 30,000 policies in our dataset. 

Homeowners Insurance is a valuable policy option that provides coverage for not just the house but also its contents and the owner's liability. Approximately 85% of homeowners have home insurance policies, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

The average annual cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. is $1,445, according to Value Penguin's 2021 analysis using a sample policy in each state. The average money spent on homeowners’ insurance coverage has risen in the past several years, across all forms of policy, based on the NAIC's survey of premiums spent. This increase in premium may be attributed to the early cancellation of claims. To understand this better, we chose to work on this project. The goal of this project is to understand the factors that are driving the customer to continue or cancel the existing policy.

Our criteria to access the model is to reduce the number of customers who have been misclassified as not canceled. Because of this, the company is not able to get a clear picture of how many customers are there with the company.
